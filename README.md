Simply adjusting the prices of a product or service based on various factors in real time, optimizing revenue by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, demographics, customer behaviour and competitor prices. 

Dynamic Pricing is an application of Data Science that involves adjusting product or service prices based on various factors in real time. It is employed by businesses to optimize their revenue and profitability by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, customer behaviour, and competitor pricing.

Using data-driven insights and algorithms, businesses can dynamically modify prices to achieve the most favourable outcomes.

For example, consider a ride-sharing company operating in a metropolitan area. The company wants to optimize its pricing strategy to maximize revenue and improve customer satisfaction. The traditional pricing model used by the business is based on fixed rates per kilometre, which does not account for fluctuations in supply and demand.

By implementing a dynamic pricing strategy, the company can leverage data science techniques to analyze various factors such as historical trip data, real-time demand, traffic patterns, and events happening in the area.

Using Machine Learning algorithms, the company can analyze data and adjust its prices in real-time. When demand is high, such as during rush hours or major events, the algorithm can increase the cost of the rides to incentivize more drivers to be available and balance the supply and demand. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the algorithm can lower the prices to attract more customers.

Dynamic Pricing Strategy:
So, in a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.

To implement a data-driven dynamic pricing strategy, businesses typically require data that can provide insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other influencing factors. So to create a dynamic pricing strategy, we need to have a dataset based on:
1)historical sales data
2)customer purchase patterns
3)market demand forecasts
4)cost data
5)customer segmentation data, 
6)real-time market data.

The data provided by the company states that the company uses a pricing model that only takes the expected ride duration as a factor to determine the price for a ride. Now, we will implement a dynamic pricing strategy aiming to adjust the ride costs dynamically based on the demand and supply levels observed in the data. It will capture high-demand periods and low-supply scenarios to increase prices, while low-demand periods and high-supply situations will lead to price reductions.
